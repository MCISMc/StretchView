# StretchView - Chrome Extension

Force stretch videos to full screen display and remove annoying black bars from popular streaming websites
An extension created for Google Chrome™ to give you full view experience, while watching online videos in Google Chrome™ Web Browser.
Force stretch videos on all major streaming websites like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon PrimeVideo, Hotstar, SonyLiv, JioCinema, AltBalaji, Voot, Zee5, ErosNow and more!. 
With this extension, you can enjoy the truly full-screen viewing experience on computer/laptop screen by stretching or cropping the streaming video from a website to the desired corrected aspect ratio, and remove annoying Letterbox on video [black bars] as much as accurate cropping to your screen resolution from your favorite streaming websites.

* You can choose from the option buttons to select the desired mode of cropping or can use the shortcut key "G" to cycle through all the available mode.
* Video Adjustment Feature ( Beta ) added, you can correct the desired brightness, contrast, and saturation value for video player currently active on the supported website

Feel free to tell me any things you like or dislike as well as graphical changes and I'll take everything into consideration. Thanks for trying out StrechView, and I hope you enjoy StrechView.
